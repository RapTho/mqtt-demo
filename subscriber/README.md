# MQTT Subscriber App

## Introduction

This is a Python application that subscribes to messages from an MQTT broker. It uses the Paho MQTT library to connect to the broker and forwards messages to a Cloudant database on IBM Cloud.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, create a virtual environment and install the requirements using pip:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

To configure the app, create a .env file in the root of the project with the following variables:

- BROKER_ADDRESS: the address of the MQTT broker
- USERNAME: the username to use when connecting to the broker
- PASSWORD: the password to use when connecting to the broker
- PORT: the port to use when connecting to the broker
- TOPIC: the topic to publish messages to
- CLOUDANT_USERNAME: the username to use when connecting to the Cloudant database
- CLOUDANT_PASSWORD: the password to use when connecting to the Cloudant database
- CLOUDANT_DB_NAME: the name of the Cloudant database
- CLOUDANT_HOST: the host of the Cloudant database
- SCHEMA: the message's schema

Example .env file:

```
BROKER_ADDRESS="localhost"
USERNAME="student1"
PASSWORD="password1"
TOPIC="student1/topic"
PORT=8083
CLOUDANT_USERNAME="apikey-v2-xxxx"
CLOUDANT_PASSWORD="myCloudantPassword"
CLOUDANT_DB_NAME="raphael-test"
CLOUDANT_HOST="https://e11b279a-7332-4e48-846e-886a31a1b101-bluemix.cloudantnosqldb.appdomain.cloud"
SCHEMA={"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "integer"}, "message": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "message"]}
```

## Start the subscriber app

To start the subscriber, run the main.py file:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Build and deploy app

To build the container image and deploy it on IBM Code Engine. The process is extensively documented in the [mosquitto folder](../mosquitto/).

The steps will be similar but another [Containerfile](./Containerfile) is provided

Set new environment variables for the deployment process

```bash
export RESOURCE_GROUP=iot-digital-engineering
export CR_NAMESPACE=hslu-iot-digital-engineering
export IMAGE_NAME=subscriber-raphael
export IMAGE_TAG=1.0
```

Use secret and configmap from the kubernetes/subscriber folder to create new configuration for the subscriber. <br />

After building and pushing your container image, you can deploy it. This time we will deploy the subscriber as a `job` of type `daemon`, as the subscriber doesn't expose any endpoint.

Create the daemon job

```bash
ibmcloud ce job create --mode daemon --name subscriber-${USER} --image de.icr.io/${CR_NAMESPACE}/${IMAGE_NAME}:${IMAGE_TAG} --registry-secret ibm-container-registry-${USER} --env-from-configmap subscriber-conf-${USER} --env-from-secret subscriber-secret-${USER} --cpu 0.25 --memory 0.5G
```

Run an instance of the daemon job

```bash
ibmcloud ce jobrun submit --name subscriber-run-${USER} --job subscriber-${USER}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connect to IBM Code Engine's Kubernetes-API

To use `kubectl` with IBM Code Engine, you can set the context as documented [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-kubernetes)

```bash
ibmcloud ce project select -n iot-digital-engineering --kubecfg
```

Now you can do everything you're authorized to :)

### Get Pods

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

### Check logs of a specific pod

Replace `myPodName` with the name of your pod. You can also use the `-f` option to subscribe to incoming logs

```bash
kubectl logs pod/myPodName
```
